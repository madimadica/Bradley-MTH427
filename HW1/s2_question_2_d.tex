Compute (by hand) a 98\% confidence interval for the average per gallon gas tax in the U.S. Compare
the length of this interval and the one in part (b). (Hint: the sample standard deviation $s = 7.138$)

\soln* $\Xbar \approx 39.556$, $\df = 18-1 = 17$, and $\alpha = 0.02$. Then $t_{\alpha/2}(17) = t_{0.01}(17) = 2.567$.

\nl Then the CI is $39.556 \pm 2.567 \pfrac{7.138}{\sqrt{18}} \equiv (35.237, 43.875)$. The measure of this interval is $8.638$ cents, whereas in part (b) the measure was $5.85328$ cents. Higher confidence levels require more of the domain since $\lim_{\alpha \to 0^+} \equiv D$.
