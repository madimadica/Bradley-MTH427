Is there sufficient evidence to claim that the average gas tax is less that 45.2 cents? (Make sure to
specify hypotheses and the p-value).

\soln* $H_0 := \mu = 45.2$ and $H_a := \mu < 45.2$.

\noindent Since $p =0.003758 \leq 0.1 = \alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis ($H_0$). Hence, there is sufficient evidence that the true mean of the gas tax is less than 45.2 cents.
