Is there a strong seasonality in the series? Explain.

\nl There is strong seasonality in the series because of the ACF plots having periodic spikes in the residuals. These occur every 12 datapoints, also known as every year (season). This can also be observed in the detrended data from part (c) whereby it follows a fairly consistent wave pattern with evenly spaced peaks.
