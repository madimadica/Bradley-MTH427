$x_t = 3x_{t-1} + w_t + w_{t-1} - 2 w_{t-2}$

$$(1-3B)x_t = (1+B-2B^2)w_t$$
$$(1-3z) = (1-z)(1+2z)$$
$$\underbrace{1-3z}_{\phi(z)} = \underbrace{(1-z)(1+2z)}_{\theta(z)}$$
$$x_t = 3x_{t-1} + w_t + w_{t-1} - 2 w_{t-2} \quad \implies \quad \ARMA(1,2)$$
Since $\phi(z)$ has root $\frac{1}{3} \leq 1$, the model is not causal.\\
Since $\theta(z)$ has roots 1 and $-\frac12$, and the $\abs{1} \leq 1$, the model is not invertible.
