Test whether there is a linear relationship between the predictor and the response?
(i.e test whether the regression coefficient (slope) is zero: $H_0 : \beta_1 = 0$ vs $H_a : \beta_1 \neq 0$)

\soln* Since the R summary says $p < 2 \times 10^{-16}$, we are extremely confident the slope is non-zero.
