Implement the test in part (d) (Do the data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a
difference in mean BMI between the heavy-smoking women 6 years after quitting smoking
and the never-smoking women at 6-year follow-up.)

\soln* Since the p value is large ($> 0.1$ in this case), we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and hence there is insufficient evidence that the smokers and non smokers BMI is difference.
