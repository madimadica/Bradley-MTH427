Display a scatter plot between \textbf{mpg} and \textbf{horsepower}. Does the scatter plot suggest
a linear relationship between the two variables? Explain why?

\soln* The plot suggests some linearity since the data is clustered in a downwards trend, but it looks closer to a graph of $y(x)=1/x$. The correlation coefficient from the summary is $0.6049$, so it has a regular amount of correlation (not strong, not weak).
