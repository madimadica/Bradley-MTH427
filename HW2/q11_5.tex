What did housing prices look like in the \say{good old days}? The median sale prices for new single-family houses are given in the accompanying table for the years 1972 through 1979.${}^1$ Letting $Y$ denote the median sales price and $x$ the year (using integers $1,2, \ldots, 8$), fit the model $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon$. What can you conclude from the results?

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{lc}
         \hline
         Year & Median Sales Price ($\times 1000$)\\
         \hline
         1972 (1) & \$27.60 \\
         1973 (2) & \$32.50 \\
         1974 (3) & \$35.90 \\
         1975 (4) & \$39.30 \\
         1976 (5) & \$44.20 \\
         1977 (6) & \$48.80 \\
         1978 (7) & \$55.70 \\
         1979 (8) & \$62.90 \\
         \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\soln* The summary shows that our equation is $\yhat = 4841.7x + 21575$. This means that in 1971 (year 0) the expected value of the median sales price was \$21575 and increased annually by an average of \$4841.70.
