Give an interpretation of the coefficients in term of \textit{mpg} and \textit{horsepower}

\soln* The intercept $\beta_0$ means that a car with zero horsepower is expected to get 39.9 mpg. The slope coefficient $\beta_1$ means that for every unit increase of horsepower, the car's mpg will drop an average of 0.1578 units.
