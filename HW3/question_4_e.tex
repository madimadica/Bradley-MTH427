Based on the $R^2$ or Adjusted $R^2$, compare the fits of the quadratic model in part (a)
with the simple linear regression model (from Additional exercise of Homework \#2) where mpg
is the response variable and horsepower is the only predictor variable.

In homework 2 the degree 1 polynomial estimate had an R-squared of $0.6059$. In the new model the $R^2 = 0.6876$ and adjusted $R^2 = 0.686$. The new second order term helps to explain approximately 13\% more of the variance $\pfrac{0.686}{0.6049}$.
