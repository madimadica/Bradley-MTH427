Test whether all the regression coefficients are zero (there is a linear relationship
between the response and the predictors), i.e whether $\bat_1 = \bat_2 = \bat_3 = \bat_4 = 0$.

\soln* Based on the model summary, since $p = 2.2 \cdot 10^{-16} < 0.05 = \alpha$, there is sufficient evidence that all of the predictor variables are significant (non zero).
