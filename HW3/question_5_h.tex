Test whether the coefficients of the predictor(s) in (f) are all zero. Would you drop
those predictors from the full model? Why?

\soln* $H_0 : \bat_l = \bat_e = 0$ versus $H_a : \bat_l \neq 0 \lor \bat_e \neq 0$.

Since $p = 0.1095 \not < \alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_0$. Hence there is not enough evidence to indicate a relationship between the predictors limit and education with response balance. Therefore I would remove these the full model, especially since income and rating have over a 99\% significance.
