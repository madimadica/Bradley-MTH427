Do the data present sufficient evidence to indicate curvature in the response function?
That is to test the hypotheses $H_0 : \bat_2 = 0$ vs $H_a : \bat_2 \neq 0$.
(Hint: you may use the $p$-value from your summary in part (a))

Because $p = -2 \cdot 10^{-16} < 0.05 = \alpha$ we reject $H_0$ and conclude that there is evidence of curvature in the response function.
